# Boss Loot Tables

Boss Loot Tables is a very simple mod for Fabric. It allows for the usage of loot tables with vanilla bosses...
  or so I would say, but it only changes Wither loot mechanics, because I didn't realize the dragon loot table worked until *after* I decided on the name.
  
The standard Wither loot table is empty. Boss Loot Tables replaces it with a loot table that always drops 1x Nether Star. To provide your own drops, create a loot table at `minecraft:loot_tables/entities/wither.json`.

Boss Loot Tables is available for 1.15.2 and 20w20b under the releases tab on this page. MIT, do what you want.
